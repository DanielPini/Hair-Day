        <h2>About Hair Day</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Who we are</h3>
          <p>
            Based in Madison, Wisconsin, Hair Day is a boutique salon
            specialising in cut, colour and styling. We also offer makeup and
            nail services. Our focus is on personalised care and technical skill
            delivered in a warm, relaxed environment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Our approach</h3>
          <p>
            Every service begins with a consultation. Cuts are tailored to fit
            lifestyle and structure. Colour work is custom-formulated and
            executed with techniques that balance creativity and hair health. We
            are known for edgy colour and on-trend cuts, delivered with
            precision and attention to detail.
          </p>

          <h3>Treat yourself</h3>
          <p>
            Appointments at Hair Day are intended as time set aside for the
            client. Treatments, styling and grooming are performed to restore
            and refresh. We limit the number of colouring appointments each week
            to preserve quality; clients are advised to book well in advance.
          </p>

          <h3>Owner and founders</h3>
          <p>
            Pria, Hair Day’s owner, trained as a colourist and immediately
            specialised in custom, fashion-forward colouring techniques. She
            established the salon to create a “treat yourself” environment
            centred on excellent service. Pria opened Hair Day with her friend
            and stylist Garry.

          <h3>Our team</h3>
          <p>
            The salon staff numbers seven: two stylists, three colourists, one
            manicurist and one make-up artist. Each team member works to a
            shared standard of craft and client care.

        <section>
          <h3>Keeping you inspired</h3>
          <p>
            To help clients maintain looks between visits, our stylists publish
            makeup and nail tutorials on the Hair Day website. The tutorials are
            practical, step-by-step guides designed for use at home.

          <h3>Booking and availability</h3>
          <p>
            Because we accept a limited number of colour bookings each week, we
            recommend scheduling colour services several weeks in advance. For
            appointment requests and availability, please visit our booking page
            or contact the salon directly.
